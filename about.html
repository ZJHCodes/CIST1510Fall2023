<p id="topS"><br><b>Top Story (November)</b><br><br> You could tramp through the steamy jungles of Chiapas in southern Mexico in search of endangered scarlet macaws and loud-mouth howler monkeys. Or you could put up your tent, put up your feet and let the critters come to you in the grassy camping area at Centro Ecoturistico Las Guacamayas (about US$2.50 per person per night).
    This preserve, on the banks of the LacantÃºn River abutting the vast Monte Azul Biosphere Reserve (one of the most bio-diverse areas in all of North America), has been very successful at increasing the scarlet macaw population and attracting tourists. So much so that we woke up after our first night in the campground to discover that the tree next to our tent had been taken over by scarlet macaws.
    Up to 10 of them at a time were feasting in a tree literally right next to our tent. We spent the entire day in our comfy camp chairs sipping coffee (and, later, cold beers) and watching the vibrant birds stuff themselves silly.
    In the late afternoon, a small family of howler monkeys showed up as well and decided to spend the night in another nearby tree. The following morning their dinosaur-like roars (they really should be called roaring monkeys) served as our (very early) wake up call.</p>
